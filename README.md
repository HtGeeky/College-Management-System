                                             College Management System (CMS)

     CMS is a command-driven application that helps to maintain student and faculty records. It makes use of
     unique IDs and password to restrict the access and usage of different areas of the portal to its correct target
     audience. The faculty portal allows the faculty user to update faculty profile, including allocation of subjects
     to be taught. Likewise, the student portal helps to maintain student profile information, including allocation
     and de-allocation of subjects to the students. The admin portal is used for administrative purposes. It helps
     to make the user entry for the first time.
 
     The CMS application code makes use of a wide array of C++ programming features. These include:
     >> Concept of inheritance for code reusability
     >> Concept of function overloading that enhances the code readability
     >> Handling of simple exceptions
     >> Application of file-handling concepts for performing operations, such as read, write, append, check for
        varlous O errors. etc
     >> Use of various I/0 manipulators to display the output in a formatted manner
